Precision in traffic flow prediction represents a pivotal technology within the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), playing a critical role in the planning of future trips, the enhancement of urban transportation efficiency, and the support of decision-making processes by traffic management authorities. Current mainstream graph-convolutional networks predominantly depend on a priori knowledge to depict the spatial dependencies of road networks in the context of predefined adjacency matrices. However, the predefined or adaptive adjacency matrices employed for such static modeling of spatial dependencies are challenging to accurately reflect the dynamically changing spatial associations between road segments over time, thus limiting the precise prediction of traffic flow. To address this challenge, a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network and Temporal Self-Attention (DGCRN-TSA) is proposed for traffic flow prediction. The proposed method integrates a dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network with a recurrent neural network-based dynamic graph generation model to construct a dynamic graph from time-varying traffic signals, facilitating the simultaneous extraction of spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the model separates abnormal signals from normal traffic signals and employs a data-driven approach to model abnormal signals, thereby further enhancing the prediction efficacy. The model incorporates a novel temporal attention mechanism, which utilizes local contextual information to enhance the transformation of numerical sequence representations. This mechanism enables the prediction model to capture dynamic temporal dependencies in traffic flows, thereby contributing to long-term prediction. An analysis of four real datasets revealed that DGCRN-TSA outperforms current state-of-the-art prediction methods in terms of performance.
